#Exercise 1
#Optimization and parallelization of the kernel SVC  (support vector classifier)

#Steps to follow


1. Parallelize and optimize the scikit-learn version of the kernel SVC (using MPI/Openmp on the c++ code)
   
2. Porting of the code to GPU (using pytorch/cupy/numba)

2. Perform a performance analysis of the code scaling, testing datasets with different size/number of features,
different numbers of core, and also different number of GPUs

#Exercise 2
#Optimization  and parallelization of the kernel-PCA  

1. Parallelize and optimize the scikit-learn version of the kernel-PCA, serial code provided (using dask/mpi4py)
   
2. Porting of the code to GPU (using pytorch/cupy/numba)

2. Perform a performance analysis of the code scaling, testing datasets with different size/number of features,
different numbers of core, and also different number of GPUs
